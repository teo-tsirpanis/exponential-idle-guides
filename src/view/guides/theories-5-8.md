### Graduation routing

Remember to follow our routing advice from the [introduction to graduation](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/intro-to-grad/#graduation-routing).

### Student routing with R9

All routing follows the [student calculator](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/students.html) (by Niedzielan, AfuroZamurai, and Milla) and
[star calculator](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/stars.html) (by Eaux Tacous#1021). When you are not pushing \\(f(t)\\) you should always have the 9th research option maxed (after Theory 8). When pushing \\(f(t)\\), you should be R9 seaping (below).

There is also the [theory simulator](https://theory-simulator.tredec.repl.co/) by XLII (for theories w/ max milestones).

#### How to push F(t) with R9 swapping

###### Memorize your student distributions with and without 10/20/30 R9 students. Use the [student calculator](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/students.html) if needed. You will commonly see people refer to this as R9 seaping as a long held name of the strategy.

1. Wait till \\(f(t)\\) stops growing with students in R9 pushing \\(\tau\\).
2. Start accel (preferably keep it between prestiges).
3. Potentially sit here to stack t for bigger \\(\phi_2\\) when you have students in \\(\phi_2\\). Only do this when you are near a graduation mark. This is not useful if you will not swap into \\(\phi_2\\).
4. Respec all 10/20/30 students from R9.
5. Wait for the autoprestige to prestige and swap back students to R9.
6. Repeat.

This method allows you to push \\(f(t)\\) with almost no loss of R9
uptime or pushing power. This is harder with fewer levels of R9 but
still helps if you get used to it.

#### R9 autoprestige expression

You can find the autoprestige used for R9 Seaping here: [Equation](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/intro-to-grad/#new-autoprestige-expression). If you don't have this expression, then you will have to manually prestige each seap.

### Theory 1

You will not touch this theory until after ee14k. Once you begin pushing T1 after ee14k, begin using the <a href="https://replit.com/@xelaroc/AnthSim">Theory Sim</a> and <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/theory-sim/">Sim Guide</a> to give the best strategy and multiplier for the next publication.

### Theory 2

This theory will be used as overnight until 1e350 Tau where it will not be touched until after ee14k. See our earlier guide for an overview for [theory 2](/guides/theories-1-4/#theory-2-25s-6k).

### Theory 3

See our earlier guide for an overview for [theory 3](/guides/theories-1-4/#theory-3-30s-7k).

### Theory 4

See our earlier guide for an overview for [theory 4](/guides/theories-1-4/#theory-4-35s-8k).

### Theory 5 (40σ / 9k)

#### Variable overview

\\(q_1\\) & \\(q_2\\):  Simple multipliers that directly affect \\(\rho\\)
production. \\(q_2\\) is a doubling while \\(q_1\\) is not.

\\(q\\): The crux of T5 is to grow this value as fast as possible, while
increasing its maximum value.

\\(c_1\\): Increases the speed that \\(q\\) will approach its limit. You
need enough levels of \\(c_1\\) to allow \\(q\\) to reach its limit,
once \\(q\\) has reached its cap \\(c_1\\) has no additional benefit
until more \\(c_2\\) is purchased.

\\(c_2\\): Doubles the limit of \\(q\\) and halves the effect of \\(c_1\\).
Needed to balance 2 parts of the equation appearing twice: \\(c_1/c_2\\)
and \\(c_3^{1.1}-q/c_2\\). If you buy too much \\(c_2\\), it will make
\\(q\\) growth effectively nothing as \\(c_1/c_2\\) approaches \\(0\\).
However, you still need to buy \\(c_2\\) when \\(q\\) approaches
\\(c_2*c_3^{1.1}\\) because \\(c_3^{1.1}-q/c_2\\) approaches \\(0\\)
making \\(q=c_2*c_3^{1.1}\\) the maximum value of \\(q\\).

\\(c_3\\): Increases the limit of \\(q\\) by \\(2^{1+m/20}\\), where \\(m\\)
is the number of milestones, by increasing what
\\(q/c_2\\) fraction can reach. It does not have the problems of \\(c_2\\)
as lowering your \\(\dot{q}\\), making it an always auto-bought variable.

#### T5 strategy

Theory 5 benefits the most from active play and a lot of attention
making it the strongest theory until the very late game due
to a very low multiplier decay rate. Here is what is known about optimal multiplier: \\(3\\) until \\(e25\\);
\\(6\\) to \\(10\\) during mid to late game. Publishing at higher
multiples is not drastically less efficient and allows for slightly less
active play. When you have max milestones, use the <a href="https://replit.com/@xelaroc/AnthSim">Theory Sim</a> and <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/theory-sim/">Sim Guide</a> to give the multiplier for the next publication.

##### Active

Running the active strats, with some modifications, will help you get
this theory to \\(e30\\) easily, but it will take some time. A step-by-step on
how to progress the theory is detailed below.

Before e30, you should repeat this after every publication:
<ol type="1">
   <li>Buy everything <b>except</b> c<sub>2</sub></li>
   <li>Once q growth reduces, c<sub>2</sub> levels can then be purchased individually. Only buy when c<sub>2</sub> is e1 lower than your current ρ, shown visually on the graph when it plateaus.</li>
   <li>When you are within e10 of your last publication, you should buy everything but q<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>1</sub>. You should then manually buy q<sub>1</sub> and c<sub>1</sub> when it costs e1 lower than q<sub>2</sub> doubling. (c<sub>1</sub> only when q is not capped)</li>
   <li>Repeat until e25. At e25, push for e30 with 0/1/0
   milestone and start x6-10 multipliers.</li>
</ol>

After autobuy at e30, you should repeat this after every publication:
<ol type="1">
   <li>x1 (or x10 when above e200) buy c<sub>2</sub> manually and autobuy the rest until within ~e10 of your previous publication. Your graph should resemble a linear function on the graph.</li>
   <li>As purchasing c<sub>2</sub> becomes less frequent and q growth will slow down at this point you should stop autobuying c<sub>1</sub> & q<sub>1.</sub></li>
   <li>Around your last pub mark, you can start auto-buying c<sub>2</sub>. At this point, you should:</li>
   <ol type="a">
      <li>buy q<sub>1</sub> up to 15% of the cost of the next doubling purchase (2<sup>x</sup> purchase),</li>
      <li>and buy c<sub>1</sub> after you purchase c<sub>2</sub> until q reaches its new cap.</li>
   </ol>
   <li>Once you reach your desired multiplier, publish. </li>
   <li>Repeat this for stonks.</li>
</ol>

T5 will always give its best results from active play. However, after
step 3, you can still get good results while auto buying \\(q_1\\) and
manually purchasing \\(c_1\\) every 10-15min. Making the theory
slightly less active.

**Warning**: Do not overnight this theory. It has terrible decay after passing a good publication mark and will not give good results. T5i is only viable very late/endgame.

##### Additional information

Purchase \\(c_2\\) when  \\(1.5q > c_2*c_3^{m_3}\\). \\(m_3\\) is
the number of milestone 3.

\\(q\\) begins to slow down when you reach \\(2q > c_2*c_3^{m_3}\\).

### Theory 6 (45σ / 10k)

#### T6 strategy

This theory has the lowest decay of all the theories. It will be second
place to T5 until about e750 and is the only theory that can
get to \\(>e1100τ\\). You should overnight this after you get your T2 to
\\(e350+\\). This is the best idle theory. [Video of T6 at Endgame](https://bit.ly/t6endgame)

The optimal publication multiplier is still unknown but empirically
seems to be about \\(7\\)-\\(12\\). Once all milestones, disable \\(c_3\\)
\\(c_4\\) and autobuy rest. For manual autobuy \\(q_2\\), \\(r_2\\),
\\(c_2\\), and \\(c_5\\) then manual buy rest with \\(c_3\\) and \\(c_4\\)
still disabled. For idle/auto, you are going to just turn off \\(c_3\\)
and \\(c_4\\).

### Theory 7 (50σ / 11k)

#### T7 overview

T7 can be summarized as a maximization problem : given a surface in 3-dimensional space,
you want to find its highest altitude by moving along the surface, always in the direction
of steepest ascent (that's basically a gradient ascent).
The function \\(g(x,y)\\) can be seen as a surface in \\(\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) (considering the set
of points \\((x,y,g(x,y))\\), see attached image).
\\((\rho_1,\rho_2,g(\rho_1,\rho_2))\\) is a point on this surface. Our goal is to
maximize \\(g(\rho_1,\rho_2)\\), i.e. to find \\((\rho_1,\rho_2)\\) that maximize \\(g(\rho_1,\rho_2)\\).
Notice that the function \\(g\\) is unbounded, i.e. you can't find a proper maximum (we say that the maximization problem is ill-conditioned); so one way to maximize \\(g(\rho_1,\rho_2)\\) is to move \\((\rho_1,\rho_2)\\) towards the direction of steepest ascent.
This is what is precisely done by setting \\(\dot{\mathbf{\rho}}\\) (which is the direction the
point \\(\mathbf{\rho}=(\rho_1,\rho_2)\\) will move toward) to \\(\nabla g(\rho_1,\rho_2)\\)
(i.e. the gradient of \\(g\\) evaluated at \\((\rho_1,\rho_2)\\), which gives the direction of
steepest ascent of \\(g\\) at the point \\((\rho_1,\rho_2)\\).

![T7 Graph of function](/images/T7-graph.png)

This is the graph of the function \\(g\\), taken after the first four milestones have been unlocked
(Note: here, coefficients like \\(c_1,c_2\ldots\\) are ignored. The effect of those coefficients is
simply making the graph steeper in \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) direction, depending on the value of each coef).

#### T7 strategy

The optimal publication multiplier is \\(4\\)-\\(6\\). You will swap from 0/1/1 → 0/0/2 at near the 2/3 mark of your next milestone. The strategy for
manual buy before 4 milestones is to only manual buy \\(q_1\\) and \\(c_1\\)
cheap (e1 less \\(\rho\\)) and the rest full auto. After milestone 5, turn it on full autobuy for idle. For active, you will follow the strat described in the [theory sim guide](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/theory-sim/) or watch the video below.

### Theory 8 skipping

T8 skip is significantly faster than buying T8 right away (don't worry, you will still buy it, just at 14k, not 12k). T8 is very slow until you get to about \\(e60\\) (it took the sim 16 hours to get that far into the theory without R9). We highly recommend buying t8 for the achievement, then selling it right away and using those students for \\(\phi\\). You will need
about e1350 \\(\tau\\) in order to get R9 (\\(ee14k\\)) without T8, which will help you get through T8 faster than before. **You will need to buy T8 again to get R9, and you should start R9 right away after that**. The current recommendation for your \\(\tau\\) distribution for T8 skip is as follows:

<table class="newwords">
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th class="invisible"></th>
         <th>Tau</th>
         <th class="invisible"></th>
         <th class="invisible"></th>
         <th>Tau</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td class="leftHeader">T1</td>
         <td>e200 τ</td>
         <th class="invisible"></th>
         <td class="leftHeader">T5</td>
         <td>e250 τ</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td class="leftHeader">T2</td>
         <td>e275 τ</td>
         <th class="invisible"></th>
         <td class="leftHeader">T6</td>
         <td>e150 τ</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td class="leftHeader">T3</td>
         <td>e150 τ</td>
         <th class="invisible"></th>
         <td class="leftHeader">T7</td>
         <td>e150 τ</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td class="leftHeader">T4</td>
         <td>e175 τ</td>
         <th class="invisible"></th>
         <td class="leftHeader">T8</td>
         <td>Skip</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>

If your numbers are different, that is fine. You just need to reach 1e1350
\\(\Pi\tau\\) to get to R9 at 14k.

### Theory 8 (55σ / 12k)

#### T8 strategy

The optimal publication multiplier is 2.5-5 depending on how close you
are to the next milestone. This theory is extremely slow at the start
which is why we skip until we obtain R9. It is also the only one with a
\\(1e20\\) milestone step. It will speed up once you hit 1e60 and
even faster at \\(1e80\\) and \\(1e100\\) etc. until ~\\(e250\\)-\\(e300\\).
The worst part is the \\(1e50\\)-\\(1e60\\) grind. The grind to \\(1e60\\)
will take a good bit of time but is faster with R9.

At the start, manual buy prioritizes \\(c_2\\) then \\(c_1\\) then rest.
Once you get to 0/0/0/2, prioritize \\(c_2\\) and \\(c_5\\) then \\(c_1\\) then the
rest. Once at 2/0/3/0, you will prioritize \\(c_2\\) and \\(c_4\\) then \\(c_1\\) then
the rest after. This continues to max at 2/3/3/3.
