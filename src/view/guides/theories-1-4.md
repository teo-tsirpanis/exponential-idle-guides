### Theory basics

Publications are equivalent to prestiges for \\(f(t)\\) so don't be afraid to
use them. However, the best publication multipliers vary from theory to theory and will
change over time. If you are close to a multiplier you want, turn off autobuyer
and let \\(\rho\\) increase without buying upgrades for a faster short-term increase
before the publication (turn on after you publish). This is known and referenced as "cruising".
Total \\(τ\\), found in the equation or at the top of the screen, is a multiplicative
combination of all \\(τ\\) from each theory.

__Don’t be afraid to skip getting all milestones to work on the next or a
better theory.__

###### Note: If you see # → [# → # → #] → # in the milestone route of a theory, this is the section that has an active strategy tied to it.

### Graduation routing

Remember to follow our routing advice from [Introduction to Graduation](https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/intro-to-grad/#graduation-routing).

### Theory 1 (20σ / 5k)

#### T1 Overview

In mathematics, a recurrence relation is an equation that relies on an
initial term and a previous term to change.
We start with the current tick’s term, \\(ρ_{n}\\), and a constant add-on to
obtain the value of the next tick, \\(ρ_{n+1}\\). This gives us an equation
equivalent to \\(ρ=at+constant\\), with a changing value \\(a\\) and a constant
that is the initial value of 1. Later when we add the \\(c_{3}ρ_{n-1}^{0.2}\\) term,
this is now saying that we are now adding each tick the value of \\(ρ\\) from
the previous tick ago with a constant \\(c_{3}\\) put to the power of \\(0.2\\). This
is the same with the next term \\(c_{4}ρ_{n-2}^{0.3}\\), with the value of \\(ρ\\) two ticks
ago and a multiplier \\(c_4\\) put to the power \\(0.3\\). When we multiply the
\\(c_1c_2\\) term by the term \\(1+ln(ρ)/100\\) changing the constant addition to
being based on the value of \\(ρ\\) from the previous tick with the value of
\\(1+ln(ρ)/100\\). The final milestone upgrade raises the exponent of \\(c_1\\) from
\\(1.00\\) to \\(1.05\\) to \\(1.10\\) to \\(1.15\\).

This theory also has its adjusted tickspeed calculated by \\(q_{1}*q_{2}\\). This
lengthens the normal tick length of \\(0.1/sec\\) to that value which speeds
up the theory.

#### T1 formula

##### Initial

\\[ρ_{n+1} = ρ_n + c_1c_2\\]

##### First milestone

\\[ρ_{n+1} = ρ_n + c_1c_2 + c_3ρ_{n-1}^{0.2}\\]

##### Second milestone

\\[ρ_{n+1} = ρ_n + c_1c_2 + c_3ρ_{n-1}^{0.2} + c_4ρ_{n-2}^{0.3}\\]

##### Third milestone

\\[ρ_{n+1} = ρ_n + c_1c_2 \left( 1+\frac{ln(ρ_n)}{100} \right) \\\ + c_3ρ_{n-1}^{0.2} + c_4ρ_{n-2}^{0.3}\\]

##### Fourth to Sixth milestone

\\[ρ_{n+1} = ρ_n + c_1^{1.15}c_2 \left( 1+\frac{ln(ρ_n)}{100} \right) \\\ + c_3ρ_{n-1}^{0.2} + c_4ρ_{n-2}^{0.3}\\]

#### T1 strategy

The publication multiplier has no optimal fit, as it fluctuates a lot,
but here is known: 4-6 to start; 3-4 between 1e100 and 1e150; the
publication multiplier oscillates between 2.5 and 5 past e150. Once you
get your second milestone, you can turn off \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) until e150 active strat.

The active strat follows but only works when you have all milestones
past e150. T1 is the only theory where the recent value of \\(ρ\\)
influences the rate of change of \\(ρ\\) therefore buying a variable as
soon as you can afford it will slow your progress. Lategame, buying
upgrades immediately will slow you more than the benefit of the upgrade
because \\(c_3\\) & \\(c_4\\) dominate. If the next level costs \\(10ρ\\)
and you have \\(11ρ\\) buying it will reduce to \\(ρ_{n+1}\\) to \\(1\\)
you are reducing your \\(ρ_{n+1}\\) by roughly a factor of \\(10\\).
There are \\(3\\) terms that influence the rate of change of \\(ρ\\).
All are affected by the previous state of \\(ρ\\). Let’s ignore the
first since it has such a small influence and consider the above case to
determine when an upgrade would be better. The values below are to be
only used when you are past \\(e150 τ\\) and max milestones. Buy each
variable when \\(ρ_1\\) is \\(x\\) times larger than that variable’s cost.
For example, if \\(q_1\\) costs \\(2\\), buy it when \\(ρ_1\\) is
\\(2*5.0=10 ρ_1\\).

### Theory 2 (25σ / 6k)

#### T2 Overview

This second theory is focusing on derivatives. Derivatives in
mathematics are the rate of change of the function they are the
derivative of. For the case of \\(q_1\\)  and \\(q_2\\), \\(q_2\\) is
the derivative of \\(q_1\\). This follows the power rule for derivatives:

\\[q=a*t^n ↔ q’=n*a*t^{n-1}\\]

In simpler terms, it works similar to how
\\(x_i\\) upgrades work for \\(f(t)\\) equation with continuous addition
of the previous \\(term*dt\\) to the next \\(x_{i+1}\\) term, but with
continuous addition of \\(q_i*dt\\) to the term above \\(q_{i-1}\\).
These two values of \\(r_1\\) and \\(q_1\\) are multiplied to produce the derivative
of \\(ρ(t)\\), shown by the newton derivative form \\(\dot{ρ}\\). This would give the
equation of \\(ρ\\) to be \\(ρ(t+dt)=\dot{ρ}+ρ1*dt\\). The other milestones besides more \\(q\\)
and \\(r\\) derivatives increase the exponent of \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) respectively. The
reason why \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) derivatives are more powerful long-term than the
exponents is that they take time to build up and eventually overtake and
keep increasing \\(q_1\\) and \\(r_1\\) while the exponents have a never-changing
boost.

#### T2 formula

##### Initial

\\[q_1(t+dt)=q_1+q_2*dt\\]

\\[r_1(t+dt)=r_1+r_2*dt\\]

\\[\dot{ρ}=q_1r_1\\]

##### First milestone

\\[q_1(t+dt)=q_1+q_2*dt+\frac{1}{2}q_3dt^2\\]

\\[r_1(t+dt)=r_1+r_2*dt\\]

\\[\dot{ρ}=q_1r_1\\]

##### Second milestone

\\[q_1(t+dt)=q_1+q_2*dt+\frac{1}{2}q_3dt^2+\frac{1}{6}q_4dt^3\\]

\\[r_1(t+dt)=r_1+r_2*dt\\]

\\[\dot{ρ}=q_1r\\]

##### Third and Fourth milestones

\\[q_1(t+dt)=q_1+q_2*dt+\frac{1}{2}q_3dt^2+\frac{1}{6}q_4dt^3\\]

\\[r_1(t+dt)=r_1+r_2*dt+\frac{1}{2}r_3dt^2+\frac{1}{6}r_4dt^3\\]

\\[\dot{ρ}=q_1r_1\\]

##### Fifth to Seventh milestones

\\[q_1(t+dt)=q_1+q_2*dt+\frac{1}{2}q_3dt^2+\frac{1}{6}q_4dt^3\\]

\\[r_1(t+dt)=r_1+r_2*dt+\frac{1}{2}r_3dt^2+\frac{1}{6}r_4dt^3\\]

\\[\dot{ρ}=q_1r_1^{1.15}\\]

##### Eight to Tenth milestones

\\[q_1(t+dt)=q_1+q_2*dt+\frac{1}{2}q_3dt^2+\frac{1}{6}q_4dt^3\\]

\\[r_1(t+dt)=r_1+r_2*dt+\frac{1}{2}r_3dt^2+\frac{1}{6}r_4dt^3\\]

\\[\dot{ρ}=q_1^{1.15}r_1^{1.15}\\]

#### T2 strategy

The optimal multiplier is pretty high and is not known before \\(e30\\).
The multipliers for active play we know at the moment are:\\(e25\\)-\\(e100\\)
is \\(1k\\) to \\(10k\\); \\(e100\\)-\\(e175\\) \\(10k\\)-\\(100k\\).

##### Idle

For the idle strategy, you want to prioritize your milestones on x/x/0/0
with \\(q_{3}\\) and \\(q_{4}\\) being more important than \\(r_{3}\\)
and \\(r_{4}\\). If you have more than 5 milestones, you will prioritize
\\(q\\) exponent over the \\(r\\) exponent. You will want to publish at
about a \\(1000\\) multiplier, but larger multipliers are fine.

##### Active

The goal of the active strategy is to grow \\(q_1\\) and \\(r_1\\) as
much as possible while being able to take advantage of the exponent
milestones. The active for T2 is on a 1-minute cycle: 40 seconds on
0/0/x/x milestones and 10-20 sec on x/x/0/0 milestones. You will start a
publication on 0/0/x/x as the cost of the x/x/0/0 milestone upgrades are
too large for you to get right away. When you can afford them, you will
start the cycle. This is what you will do for the following number of
milestones:

Past \\(e175\\), the active strat will become exponentially less
effective. At \\(e250\\), you would start to idle T2 overnight only.
Until you are \\(1e350\\)+ \\(τ\\) for theory 2, this is the best theory
to run idle overnight.

###### When you get to Theory 3 at ee7k, move on to pushing Theory 3 \\(τ\\) and running T2 overnight. The above is simply as an option if you rather not work on T3 now.

### Theory 3 (30σ / 7k)

#### T3 Overview

The basis of this theory and understanding how it works is based on
matrix multiplication. Below I have put a color-coded image to display
how matrix multiplication works.

![Matrix multiplication diagram](/images/matrix-multiplication.png)

This gives the basis for why certain upgrades are more powerful than
others. The exponents on \\(b_1\\), \\(b_2\\), and \\(b_3\\)
are all directly affecting \\(ρ_1\\) production which is used for \\(\tau\\). An extra
dimension roughly gives \\(50%\\) more \\(\tau\\) production as it adds an extra term
to the \\(ρ_1\\) production.

#### T3 strategy

The optimal publication multiplier is about 2-3 without cruising and 3-4
with cruising. If you decide to play actively, there is a form of
exponent swapping strat to be aware of. This is a difficult
strategy because it requires you to notice when a certain threshold
happens. It happens when the following occurs:

\\[c_{11}*b_{1}^{1.05\text{ or }1.1}<c_{12}*b_{2}^{1.05\text{ or }1.1}\\]

When this happens swap your exponents from \\(b_1\\) to \\(b_2\\) and you will get a
little upgrade boost. It also allows for a slight push of \\(ρ_2\\) for
upgrades to \\(b_2\\) and \\(c_{12}\\), but this is a lot less impactful and less
noticeable. This strategy also works with \\(b_3\\) and \\(c_{13}\\) but is oftentimes
not as common and good to note anyways.

If you decide to buy manually, the focus areas are \\(b_1\\), \\(b_2\\), and \\(b_3\\) when
e1 lower than \\(c_{11}\\), \\(c_{12}\\), and \\(c_{13}\\). These all directly boost the production
of \\(ρ_1\\) which is used for \\(\tau\\). After this, if doing the active exponent
swapping strat in the previous paragraph, the next focus will be on \\(c_{21}\\),
\\(c_{22}\\), and \\(c_{23}\\) as these boost \\(b_2\\) production which is the more likely cause
for the exponent swap to occur. This leaves the \\(c_{31}\\), \\(c_{32}\\), and \\(c_{33}\\)
upgrades as the last priority. If you are not using the exponent
swapping strat in the previous paragraph, then all the remaining
upgrades are at equivalent priority.

At the end of any publication, around a 2-3 multiplier, you should turn
off b1 and c31 as they cost \\(ρ_1\\). You will cruise until you get to a
3-4 multiplier. Publish and turn back on \\(ρ_1\\) costing variables and
repeat.

### Theory 4 (35σ / 8k)

#### T4 Overview

We start out with just one term of constants \\(c_1c_2\\) and a changing term \\(c_3q\\) with \\(q\\) being equal to \\(q(t+dt)=q+\dot{q}*dt\\) with \\(dt=0.1\\) for each tick. \\(\dot{q}\\) is
equal to an inverse equation of \\(\dot{q}=q_1q_2/(1+q)\\) with \\(q\\) being the current value. The
first 3 milestones we grab add more terms to the \\(ρ\\) equation with \\(c_4q_2\\),
\\(c_5q_3\\), and \\(c_6q_4\\). Next, we increase \\(\dot{q}\\) by a factor of \\(2^x\\) up to \\(2^3\\) or \\(8\\). Finally, we increase the power of \\(c_1\\) from \\(1.00\\) to \\(1.15\\).

#### T4 formula

##### Initial

\\[\dot{ρ}=c_1c_2+c_3q\\]

\\[q(t+dt)=q+\frac{q_1q_2}{1+q}*dt\\]

##### First milestone

\\[\dot{ρ}=c_1c_2+c_3q+c_4q^2\\]

\\[q(t+dt)=q+\frac{q_1q_2}{1+q}*dt\\]

##### Second milestone

\\[\dot{ρ}=c_1c_2+c_3q+c_4q^2+c_5q^3\\]

\\[q(t+dt)=q+\frac{q_1q_2}{1+q}*dt\\]

##### Third milestone

\\[\dot{ρ}=c_1c_2+c_3q+c_4q^2+c_5q^3+c_6q^4\\]

\\[q(t+dt)=q+\frac{q_1q_2}{1+q}*dt\\]

##### Fourth to Sixth milestones

\\[\dot{ρ}=c_1c_2+c_3q+c_4q^2+c_5q^3+c_6q^4\\]

\\[q(t+dt)=q+2^3\frac{q_1q_2}{1+q}*dt\\]

##### Seventh milestone

\\[\dot{ρ}=c_1^{1.15}c_2+c_3q+c_4q^2+c_5q^3+c_6q^4\\]

\\[q(t+dt)=q+2^3\frac{q_1q_2}{1+q}*dt\\]

#### T4 strategy

The optimal publication multiplier is 4-6. During publications, start
with x/1/3, then you will switch to 3/0/x. This will be repeated back
and forth throughout the publication. If you decide to manually buy and
don’t have max milestones, focus on \\(q_1\\) and \\(q_2\\). The next priority is
going from the highest \\(c_x\\) upgrade down to \\(c_1\\). Each lower priority should
be bought \\(e1\\) cheaper than the priority tier above. If you decide to
manually buy at max milestones, at the beginning of publications, buy
\\(c_1\\), \\(c_2\\), \\(c_3\\), \\(q_1\\), and \\(q_2\\). Once you are within \\(e1\\)-\\(e2\\) of your publication
mark, swap to only buying \\(c_3\\), \\(q_1\\), and \\(q_2\\).

### Theory tier list (Pre-9k+)

Before you reach 9k, these are the recommended values for each theory.
You may not hit the values and have a different distribution, but work on getting these theories up to these values later. This list is in order of priority.
