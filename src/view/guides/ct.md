This guide is not for how to make CTs. This guide is for strategies and how to progress with CTs. For help with CT development, check out **#custom-theories-dev** in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3FqMuzuf4t). Explanation of each CTs' mathematical basis are to be found in-game. Only official CTs will be added to the guide with exception of QoL.
### CT Name Chart

As with theories being named T1-T9, custom theories also have abbreviations. These can be found below.
